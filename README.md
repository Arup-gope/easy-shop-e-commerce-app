# 🛒 EasyShop – Automated E-Commerce Platform on AWS EKS

**EasyShop** is a full-stack, cloud-native e-commerce application built and deployed using an **end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline** on **AWS EKS**.

The project demonstrates how to design, secure, deploy, and operate a production-grade containerized application using **modern DevOps and GitOps practices**. Cloud infrastructure is provisioned automatically using **Terraform**, while **Jenkins CI** orchestrates the complete application lifecycle including code checkout, Docker image builds, testing, and security scanning.

To enable **GitOps-based continuous deployment**, **Argo CD** and **Helm** are used to synchronize Kubernetes manifest changes directly from GitHub to the EKS cluster. The platform also includes **full-stack observability**, achieved through **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, providing real-time visibility into cluster health and application performance.

### 🔑 Key Capabilities

- Automated infrastructure provisioning on AWS using Terraform  
- End-to-end CI pipeline with Jenkins  
- Secure container builds with integrated security scanning  
- GitOps-driven deployments using Argo CD and Helm  
- Scalable Kubernetes workloads running on Amazon EKS  
- Real-time monitoring and metrics with Prometheus & Grafana  

---


## 🏗 System Architecture
1. **Infrastructure as Code:** Built the cloud infrastructure for the application on **Amazon EKS** using **Terraform** for automated provisioning.
2. **Continuous Integration:** Developed a **Jenkins** pipeline to automate code retrieval, **Docker** builds, and **Trivy** security scanning.
3. **GitOps Deployment:** Adopted **GitOps** principles with **ArgoCD** and **Helm** to enable automated synchronization of manifest changes from GitHub to the cluster.
4. **Monitoring:** Established full-stack observability by deploying **Prometheus and Grafana** to monitor real-time cluster and application performance.


## 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

The cloud infrastructure for **EasyShop** is fully provisioned using **Terraform**, enabling a consistent, repeatable, and automated deployment on **AWS**.

Terraform is used to define the entire infrastructure as code (IaC), eliminating manual setup and ensuring the environment can be recreated reliably at any time.

### 🔧 What Terraform Provisions

Terraform provisions and configures the following AWS resources:

- **Amazon EKS Cluster**
  - Managed Kubernetes control plane
  - Worker node groups for application workloads

- **Networking**
  - Custom VPC
  - Public and private subnets
  - Route tables and Internet Gateway

- **Security & Access**
  - IAM roles and policies for EKS, worker nodes, and EC2
  - Security groups with controlled inbound and outbound access

- **Jenkins CI Server**
  - EC2 instance provisioned for Jenkins
  - Security group allowing access to Jenkins UI
  - IAM role to interact with AWS, EKS, and ECR/Docker Hub

This approach ensures that both **CI infrastructure (Jenkins)** and **application runtime infrastructure (EKS)** are managed centrally through Terraform.

### 🚀 Key Benefits

- **Fully automated infrastructure provisioning** using `terraform apply`
- **Infrastructure consistency** across deployments
- **Scalable Kubernetes environment** on AWS EKS
- **Separation of concerns** between CI (Jenkins) and runtime (EKS)
- **Improved security** through IAM role-based access control

### 📤 Terraform Outputs

Terraform outputs expose critical infrastructure information such as:

- Jenkins EC2 public IP / DNS  
- EKS cluster name and endpoint  
- AWS region and VPC ID  

These outputs are later consumed by **Jenkins**, **kubectl**, and **Argo CD** to automate cluster access and deployments.

## ⚙️ Jenkins CI Pipeline

The **Jenkins CI pipeline** automates the entire lifecycle of the **EasyShop** application, from code retrieval to deployment-ready artifacts.

This pipeline is implemented using a **Jenkins Shared Library**, which encapsulates all reusable functions for building, testing, scanning, and deploying the application.

### 🔄 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Checkout**
   - Pulls the latest application code from the Git repository.
   - Supports branch selection to enable feature or mainline builds.

2. **Docker Image Build**
   - Builds Docker images for:
     - Main application (`easyshop-app`)
     - Migration jobs (`easyshop-migration`)
   - Uses `BUILD_NUMBER` as the image tag for traceability.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Runs automated tests to ensure application correctness before deployment.

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Uses **Trivy** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
   - Any critical findings fail the build, enforcing DevSecOps principles.

5. **Docker Image Push**
   - Pushes successfully built images to **Docker Hub**.
   - Credentials are securely stored in Jenkins.

6. **Kubernetes Manifest Update**
   - Updates deployment YAML files with new image tags.
   - Ensures ingress host is set correctly.
   - Commits and pushes changes to the **Kubernetes manifests Git repository**, enabling GitOps.

## 🔄 GitOps Deployment with Argo CD

**Argo CD** is used to implement a **GitOps workflow** for the **EasyShop** application.  
Instead of Jenkins directly applying Kubernetes manifests, Argo CD continuously monitors the Git repository containing deployment manifests and automatically synchronizes them to the Kubernetes cluster.

### 🧭 Workflow Overview

1. **Monitor Git Repository**
   - Watches the repository where Jenkins commits updated Kubernetes manifests.
   - Detects changes in image tags, ingress configurations, or any other resource updates.

2. **Automatic Synchronization**
   - Applies changes automatically to the **EKS cluster**.
   - Ensures the cluster state always matches the desired state defined in Git.

3. **Status Monitoring**
   - Argo CD UI shows the health of applications and resources.
   - Supports rollbacks and visual comparison of current vs. desired states.

4. **Seamless GitOps Integration**
   - Jenkins updates manifests → Argo CD detects changes → Cluster is updated automatically.
   - No need for manual `kubectl apply` commands.
